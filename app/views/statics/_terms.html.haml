That´s not all: HALLIST will donate 2.5% of every sale to an art fund created by ARTO to invest in emerging artists. The fund will be revealed at the beginning of every year.
      %p HALLIST is non-exclusive. HALLIST understands that you might have a number of options to sell your artwork, therefore HALLIST sales agreement is non-exclusive (except for specific HALLIST collections previously discussed with you). HALLIST encourages you to keep your artwork up to date.
      %p 1.2	Galleries
      %p Working with established galleries and showing their work is very important for HALLIST. Galleries featuring in HALLIST receive 70% of the sale price for original artworks and 70% of net profit for HALLIST prints.

HALLIST disclaims all warranties with regard to the information provided, including the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

      %p A non-delivery situation arises when a buyer placed an order and submitted payment but then did not receive the item.

If this is unsuccessful, the buyer may report that the item has not arrived and open a non-delivery case by sending an email to support@hallist.com within 30 business days of making payment. Oftentimes the case process enables the buyer and seller to resolve the matter directly. Unresolved cases escalate for review and resolution by HALLIST.

      %p Please note: a buyer who paid via PayPal may have a limited time frame in which to file a claim for refund of purchase under PayPal's policies; that process is separate from HALLIST’s dispute process.

      %p •	If a case is escalated to HALLIST, the seller may be asked to provide HALLIST with additional information (for example: proof of shipping and/or delivery, proof of refund) to help resolve the dispute. If the case cannot be solved by the means listed above, HALLIST will issue a full refund to the buyer within 7 business days after HALLIST’s resolution in favor.
      %p A seller who fails to ship an item, respond to a non-delivery case or settle a disputed transaction in a reasonable manner may be suspended. Members who do not comply with HALLIST's policies may be subject to review, which can result in suspension of account privileges and/or termination. Suspended or terminated members remain obligated to pay HALLIST for all unpaid fees.
      %p Item not as described
      %p In the event the buyer received a product that is significantly different from the original listing, the buyer should first contact the seller via Conversations to try and work out the issue. If this is unsuccessful, the buyer may open an item not as described case by sending an email to support@hallist.com within 7 business days from reception of the product. The case process often enables the buyer and seller to resolve the matter directly. Unresolved cases will escalate for review and resolution by HALLIST.

      %p Please note: a buyer who paid via PayPal may have a limited time frame in which to file a claim under PayPal's policies; that process is separate from HALLIST’s dispute process.
      %p •	The seller must accurately describe the item. For custom orders, the seller and buyer should communicate about details via Conversations.

      %p •	A case may be closed after the buyer and seller reached a resolution agreement or if HALLIST issued a full refund.

If the case cannot be solved by the means listed above, HALLIST will issue a full refund to the buyer within 7 business days after the HALLIST’s resolution in favor.
      %p A seller who ships an item that doesn’t match the listing, fails to respond to a case or settle a disputed transaction in a reasonable manner may be suspended. Members who do not comply with HALLIST's policies may be subject to review, which can result in suspension of account privileges and/or termination. Suspended or terminated members remain obligated to pay HALLIST for all unpaid fees.
      %p Refusing service
      %p HALLIST encourages sellers to engage in clear and consistent communication, consider customer service best practices and honor transaction agreements. However, if a seller cannot complete a transaction due to an extraordinary circumstance, then the seller may refuse service to the buyer.
      %p •	The seller must notify the buyer of refusal of service through HALLIST Conversations.
      %p •	The seller can only refuse service prior to shipping.
      %p •	If the buyer has already paid, then HALLIST must issue a full refund to the buyer (price paid for item plus shipping).
