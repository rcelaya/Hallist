          %dd 
            %p The Site is provided HALLIST on an “as is” and on an “as available” basis.

HALLIST disclaims all warranties with regard to the information provided, including the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties; therefore, the above-referenced exclusion may be inapplicable.

HALLIST does not endorse any content submitted to the Site by any Member, or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and HALLIST expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with content.

          %dt 3. Limitation of Liability
          %dd 
            %p HALLIST shall not be liable for any damages whatsoever, and in particular HALLIST shall not be liable for any special, indirect, consequential, or incidental damages, or damages for lost profits, loss of revenue, or loss of use, arising out of or related to the site or the information contained in it, whether such damages arise in contract, negligence, tort, under statute, in equity, at law, or otherwise, even if HALLIST has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Some jurisdictions do not allow for the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages; therefore some of the above limitations may be inapplicable.

            %p A non-delivery situation arises when a buyer placed an order and submitted payment but then did not receive the item.

If this is unsuccessful, the buyer may report that the item has not arrived and open a non-delivery case by sending an email to support@hallist.com within 30 business days of making payment. Oftentimes the case process enables the buyer and seller to resolve the matter directly. Unresolved cases escalate for review and resolution by HALLIST. 

            %p Please note: a buyer who paid via PayPal may have a limited time frame in which to file a claim for refund of purchase under PayPal's policies; that process is separate from HALLIST’s dispute process.

              %li 
                %p If a case is escalated to HALLIST, the seller may be asked to provide HALLIST with additional information (for example: proof of shipping and/or delivery, proof of refund) to help resolve the dispute. If the case cannot be solved by the means listed above, HALLIST will issue a full refund to the buyer within 7 business days after HALLIST’s resolution in favor.

            %p A seller who fails to ship an item, respond to a non-delivery case or settle a disputed transaction in a reasonable manner may be suspended. Members who do not comply with HALLIST's policies may be subject to review, which can result in suspension of account privileges and/or termination. Suspended or terminated members remain obligated to pay HALLIST for all unpaid fees.

            %h5 Item not as described
            %p In the event the buyer received a product that is significantly different from the original listing, the buyer should first contact the seller via Conversations to try and work out the issue. If this is unsuccessful, the buyer may open an item not as described case by sending an email to support@hallist.com within 7 business days from reception of the product. The case process often enables the buyer and seller to resolve the matter directly. Unresolved cases will escalate for review and resolution by HALLIST. 

            %p Please note: a buyer who paid via PayPal may have a limited time frame in which to file a claim under PayPal's policies; that process is separate from HALLIST’s dispute process.

              %li 
                %p A case may be closed after the buyer and seller reached a resolution agreement or if HALLIST issued a full refund.
              %li 
                %p If a case remains unresolved, it will be escalated for review and resolution by HALLIST. Both parties must abide HALLIST's resolution.

                %p If a case is escalated to HALLIST, both buyer and seller may be asked to provide additional information (for example: photographs of the item) to help resolve the dispute.

            %p A seller who ships an item that doesn’t match the listing, fails to respond to a case or settle a disputed transaction in a reasonable manner may be suspended.

Suspended or terminated members remain obligated to pay HALLIST for all unpaid fees.

            %h5 Refusing service
            %p HALLIST encourages sellers to engage in clear and consistent communication, consider customer service best practices and honor transaction agreements.

                %p If the buyer has already paid, then HALLIST must issue a full refund to the buyer (price paid for item plus shipping).

            %p Members who abuse the privilege to refuse service may be subject to review, which can result in suspension of account privileges and/or termination. Suspended or terminated members remain obligated to pay HALLIST for all unpaid fees.
