        %h2 Privacy Policy

        %p Thank you for using HALLIST! This policy was written (by us) to help you understand what information we collect, how we use it, and what choices you have regarding your information. Weâ€™re an Internet company so it is completely normal that some of the concepts below might be a little technical, but we've tried our best to explain things in a simple and clear manner. Your questions and comments on this policy are very welcome.

        %h3 The information we collect
        %p We collect it in two ways:

        %h4 1. You give it to us or give us permission to obtain it.
        %p When you sign up for or use our products, you voluntarily give us certain information. This can include your name, profile picture, halls, comments, likes, email address you used to sign up, and any other information you provide us. If you're using HALLIST on your mobile device, you can also choose to provide us with location data.
        %p You also may give us permission to access your information in other services. For example, you may link your Facebook or Twitter account to HALLIST which allows us to obtain information from those accounts (e.g., your friends or contacts). The information we obtain from those services often depends on your settings or their privacy policies, so be sure to check what those are.
        
        %h4 2. We obtain technical information when you use our products.
        
        %p Nowadays, whenever you use a website, mobile application or other Internet service, there's certain information that almost always gets created and recorded in an automated way. The same is true when you use our products. Here are some of the types of information we collect in this way.
        %p Log Data. When you use HALLIST, our servers automatically record information about your interaction with our products ("log data"), including information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or information your mobile app sends when you use it to access HALLIST. This log data may include your Internet Protocol address, the address of the web page you were visiting before you came to HALLIST, browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, and how you used HALLIST.
        %p Depending on how you're accessing our products, we may use "cookies" (a small text file sent by your computer each time you visit our website, unique to your HALLIST account or your browser) or similar technologies to record log data. When we use cookies, we may use "session" cookies (that last until you close your browser) or "persistent" cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). For example, we may use cookies to store your language preferences or other HALLIST settings so you don't have to set them up every time you visit HALLIST.
        %p Device Information. In addition to log data, we may also collect information about the device you're using HALLIST on, including what type of device it is, what operating system you're using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you're using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you're using a Mac or a PC, an iPhone or an Android phone. To learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please also check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.


        %h3 How we use the information we collect
        %p We use it to provide you with our products and make them better, develop new products, and protect HALLIST and our users. For example, we may log how often people use two different versions of a product, which can help us understand which version is better.
        %p We also use it to offer you customized content -- including helping you discover halls or collections you might like or provide you with tailored advertising. For instance, if you've indicated that you're interested in a certain artist, we may suggest new artwork from that same artist.
        %p We also use the information we collect to:
        
        %ul
          %li 
            %p Send you updates (such as when certain activity, like comments, happen on HALLIST), newsletters, marketing materials and other information that may be of interest to you. For example, depending on your email notification settings, we may send you weekly updates that include HALLS you may like. You can choose to stop receiving these updates by updating your account settings (or through other settings we may provide).
          %li 
            %p Reply to your questions or comments.
        
        %p The information we collect may be "personally identifiable" (meaning it can be used to specifically identify you as a unique person) or "non-personally identifiable" (meaning it can't be used to specifically identify you). We use both types of information and combinations of both types, as described above. We may use or store information wherever HALLIST does business, including countries outside your own.
        
        %h3 The choices you have about your information
        
        %p Our goal:  to give you simple and significant choices over your information. If you have a HALLIST account, many of the choices you have on HALLIST are built directly into the product or your account settings. For example, you can:
        
        %ul
          %li 
            %p Access and change information in your profile page at any time.
          %li 
            %p Link or unlink your HALLIST account from an account on another service (e.g., Facebook or Twitter). For some services (like Facebook), you can also choose whether or not to publish your activity on HALLIST to that service.
          %li 
            %p Close your account at any time. When you close your account, we'll deactivate it and remove your HALLS and Collections from HALLIST. We may retain archived copies of your information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes (including to help address fraud and spam).
        %p You may have choices available to you through the device or software you use to access HALLIST. For example:
        %ul
          %li 
            %p The browser you use may provide you with the ability to control cookies or other types of local data storage.
          %li 
            %p Your mobile device may provide you with choices around how and whether location or other data is shared with us.
        %p To learn more about these choices, please see the information provided by the device or software provider.
        %p When you place orders or access your account information, we use commercially reasonable and generally accepted technological safeguards to secure any information we collect about you. In addition, your HALLIST account information is password-protected for your privacy and security. You should always take steps to protect the confidentiality of the password you select. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when you finish using a shared computer. 

        %p We operate internationally and many of our computer systems are currently based in Mexico. If you create a user account with us, you agree to this Privacy Policy regulated by the Mexican Federal Law for the Protection of Personal Data.

        %p We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices and services. We encourage you to check back, from to time, and review this Privacy Policy so that you will always know what personally identifiable information we collect, how we use it, and to whom we disclose it. Your continued use of the Site will be subject to the then current Privacy Policy.
